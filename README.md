This is an incredible blog for Curso Profesional de Git y GitHub from Platzi. See the course on: [Curso Profesional de Git y GitHub](https://platzi.com/cursos/git-github/ "Curso Profesional de Git y GitHub").


This course is ideal for those who are getting into software engineering. But if you think you know all about Git and GitHub, I recommend taking classes as well.

This is a sample as an exercise. My goal is to become a highly trained engineer. My interest is Data Science.
